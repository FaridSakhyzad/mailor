<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:13px;color:black;line-height:20px;">In working with thousands of designers, our experience is that 90% of the time when we get artwork, it is riddled with errors. We don’t want this for you. This is a systemic problem in our industry, and we have invested heavily in providing tutorials, cheat sheets and guides to help designers. But it’s only resulted in minor improvement.</p>
